# Team Labeler Action ðŸ‘¥

This repository provides a **GitHub action** to automatically **team label** on a **pull request** based author team.
This is useful if multiple team are working on the same project.

## Configuration

### Create `.github/teams.yml`

You need to provide a yml file that contains members of your teams:

```yaml
LightSide:
  - '@Yoda'
  - '@Luke'

DarkSide:
  - '@DarkVador'
  - '@Palpatine'
```

## Usage

### Create `.github/workflows/team-labeler.yml`

Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/team-labeler.yml` see [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file)) to utilize the labeler action.
This action only needs the GITHUB_TOKEN secret as it interacts with the GitHub API to modify labels. It's working for pull request and issues. The action can be used as such:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
  issues:
name: team-label
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  team-labeler:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: juicyjusung/team-labeler-action@v1.2
      with:
        repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```
